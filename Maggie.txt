This semester in AP AB Calculus, we covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelliâ€™s Law.        
Maggie, you have been very responsible, as shown in that I've never seen you turn in an assignment late. Also, you demonstrate how you are kind often, seen in how you always come early to help set up the classroom. I recommend that you meet with me outside of class more frequently to better understand this course's concepts. I see that you are strong in large group discussions and work well with other students in small groups.
